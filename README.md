# piCableCar

This repository is used to controll a [PlayMobile cable car](https://www.playmobil.ca/en/mountain-cable-car/9830.html) via Raspberry Pi and servo.

With [RaspAP](https://raspap.com/) a access point will be created to connect to the Pi without having a local network available (offline).
A website will be opended to control the device via python.
To display the page directly when connecting to the WiFi a captive portal is used.
This is done through a lokal DNS manipulation.

You will find a full instruction and video at [blog.task.media](https://blog.task.media/article/rpi/rpi-ap-dns/).
